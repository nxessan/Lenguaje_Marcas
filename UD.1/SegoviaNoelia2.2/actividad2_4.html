            I come from down in the valley
            where mister, when you're young
            They bring  you up to do like your daddy done
            Me and Mary we met in high school
            When she was just seventeen
            We'd ride out of this valley downs
            To where the fields were green
            
            We'd go down to the river
            And into the river we'd dive
            Oh, down to the river we'd ride
        </pre>
